#You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML # header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# My work primarily focuses on developing and studying Bayesian methods for solving decision-making problems. In this pursuit, I expand upon the existing theories in Bayesian statistics to provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of such decision-making algorithms. I also use these theoretical insights to design efficient algorithms with wide-ranging practical implications in both scientific and societal contexts.

I am a Clinical Assistant Professor of Management in the Quantitative Methods Area at the Daniels School of Business, Purdue University. I was a Postdoctoral research Associate in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M university. I hold a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, India. During my graduate studies, I served as a Givens Associate at Argonne National Laboratory, where I further honed my skills in computational and analytical techniques. My broader research interests encompass sequential decision-making, Bayesian statistics, stochastic optimization, and machine learning. I am passionate about teaching and enjoy designing and delivering courses related to data analytics, optimization, and machine learning.


Research Interests: Bandits,  Reinforcement learning, Stochastic programming, Stochastic optimization, Bayesian Statistics , Machine learning, and Large deviations analysis
